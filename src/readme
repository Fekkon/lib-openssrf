About:

This is a verbatim compilation of the Standard Spectrum Resource Format (SSRF)
version 3.0 into Java. The specification is defined in MCEB Pub 8 Version 3.0 
as of 2012-04-26.

Compilation:

The SSRF XSD requires certain bindings to successfully compile.

XSD compilation is not case sensitive and the SSRF XSD includes a name clash 
between the the "Remarks" complex type and the "remarks" attribute and fails 
to compile. In this implementation the internal 'remarks' attribute field is 
renamed to "attributeRemarks" enable compilation.

SSRF includes a very large number of enumerated values. See for example the varius
TListXX instances. The maximum number of allowed enumerated members is raised to 2048.

The software was compiled using the enclosed binding file and the following 
command-line statement (on Linux):

  % xjc -b binding-ssrf.xml  ssrf.xsd
